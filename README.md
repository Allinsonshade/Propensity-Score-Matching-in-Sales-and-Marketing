Propensity Score Matching in Sales and Marketing
Propensity Score Matching (PSM) is a statistical technique used to estimate the causal effect of a treatment or intervention, particularly in scenarios where randomization isn’t feasible. In sales and marketing, it helps evaluate the impact of campaigns by addressing selection bias—when customers self-select into treatment groups (e.g., opting into a discount program or seeing targeted ads).
PSM involves:
Calculating Propensity Scores: Logistic regression estimates the probability of a customer receiving the treatment based on observed factors like age, income, or past spending.
Matching: Customers in the treatment group are paired with similar customers in the control group based on their propensity scores.
Outcome Comparison: The matched groups are compared to determine the treatment's effect, such as increased sales or improved engagement.
Example in Marketing: A retailer launches a loyalty program to boost purchases. Using PSM, they compare purchase behavior between loyalty members (treated) and matched non-members (control). This approach isolates the program’s true impact, controlling for confounding factors like spending habits.
PSM enables marketers to make data-driven decisions by offering a clearer view of what drives customer behavior, ensuring campaigns are both effective and efficient.
